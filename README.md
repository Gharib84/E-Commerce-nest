## Ecommerce Store Web Application Philosophy
The philosophy behind the Ecommerce Store web application is to provide a seamless and efficient user experience through the use of TypeScript implementation from front-end to back-end using Nest TypeScript with Express.js. The application follows the MVC pattern, and implements an authentication system that utilizes Express sessions. The database design is implemented using the TypeORM library, which makes it easy to connect the application to a relational database. Additionally, the application includes a registration and login system for both customers and the store administrator.
